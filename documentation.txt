  python api for mlflow

3. creatd requirements.txt by changing the versions of all libraries ac to stablea versions and better compatilbilty with python 3.10.8


4.while designing 1. Pipeline Layer   → orchestration (what runs first, second, third)
2. Component Layer  → actual ML work
3. Utility Layer    → helpers (common)


2. What problem does setup.py solve?
The problem:

You have code in src/cnnClassifier/
Python needs to know:

Where is this package?

What is its name?
